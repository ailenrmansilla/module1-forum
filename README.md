# Overview

This webapp is coded in C# in the ASP.NET framework. It is a basic forum where you can add entries and reply to other people's posts. Its functionality allows people to interact with each other.

# Web Pages

It's composed of the Home page, where people can see a list of all of the forum's posts. Then we have a page to read an individual post and add replies. And a third page to add a new post.

# Development Environment

This program runs in C# and ASP.NET. It uses CSS for styling as well as some Bootstrap styling code. I used Microsoft's ASP.NET guide and ChatGPT to start up the project. I also watch several YouTube videos to learn how to organize the files in the directory.
* [To run the code] run 'dotnet watch run'

# Useful Websites

* [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-aspnet-core?view=vs-2022)

# Future Work

* Connect the forum to a database to store and retrieve entries.
* Add more pages and functionality.
